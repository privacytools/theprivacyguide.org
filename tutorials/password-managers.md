## What is a password manager
A password manager is simply a program that stores your passwords *securely*. Many password managers offer more functionalities like password generation, autofill and secure storage of other information. Let me stress that security is very important in a password manager, since it may contain all your passwords. 

Many browsers can save your passwords so you don't have to enter your login details in every site you use, but they are not password managers, and the passwords are not stored securely. In short: DO NOT USE THEM!

## Why would I need one?

- Secure passwords need to be long.
Computers nowadays are able to try thousands of passwords per second (brute-force attack), so a short password can be found in a matter of hours, or few days at most. A decent password should be at least 10 characters long, mixing lower and upper case, numbers and non-alphanumeric characters (for example $, ^, &...). If you think remembering one password that meets these criteria can be difficult, wait until I tell you that you should have more than one!

- You should never use the same password for different sites. 
Many websites across the internet don't use secure [HTTPS](https://theprivacyguide.org/tutorials/glossary.html#https) connections, meaning your passwords travel in [plaintext](https://theprivacyguide.org/tutorials/glossary.html#plaintext) over the internet, to be seen by whoever is looking. You don't want your super secure password to be of public knowledge!
Even if they use strong security, websites get hacked (heard of [Ashley Madison hack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashley_Madison_data_breach))? You don't want that one password leak compromises all your accounts, so each site, each account, should have a different password.

## How secure is my password?
Can you remember your password? If yes, then it probably isn't secure enough. A good password should be over 10 characters (or 15 even better), contain lower-case and upper-case alphabetic characters, contain numbers, and even contain non alphanumeric characters such as " $ @ * {...

Oh well, maybe you do have a really good password that meets all the criteria and you can remember, but you are not going to use it everywhere, right? So you need more than one strong password. How many of them can you remember? Probably not enough considering all the web logins we use nowadays.

That where password managers come into play: they can remember your passwords for you. Even more, since you don't have to remember your passwords anymore there is no need to make them memmorable. Now we can also make them longer. And let's be honest, don't even try to make up the passwords yourself, let the password manager do it (it is much better than any human at generating random passwords).

## How do password managers work?
Password managers simply store your username and password in a database, together with the corresponding website. They use strong encryption to keep this database safe, and you can only access to it with a master password. Most likely you will have to remember (only!) this one.

Usually they feature a random password generator to make strong passwords at will, and probably autotype functionality so you don't have to keep looking for the password (cool huh!).

## Online or local?
This is a hot topic, and the answer will change a lot depending on your paranoia... I mean, threat model and level of trust on third parties.

A local password manager is fully under your control, but you will need to copy the password database yourself in any other system you want to use, besides installing the password manager.

An online password manager stores the password database in the cloud so you have access to it anywhere you go. While this is very convenient, you are probably trusting a third party to keep your passwords safe.
