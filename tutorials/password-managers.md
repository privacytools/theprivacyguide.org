## What is a password manager



## Why would I need one?

- Secure passwords need to be long.
Computers nowadays are able to try thousands of passwords per second (brute-force attack), so a short password can be found in a matter of hours, or few days at most. A decent password should be at least 10 characters long, mixing lower and upper case, numbers and non-alphanumeric characters (for example $, ^, &...). If you think remembering one password that meets these criteria can be difficult, wait until I tell you that you should have more than one!

- You should never use the same password for different sites. 
Many websites across the internet don't use secure [HTTPS](https://theprivacyguide.org/tutorials/glossary.html#https) connections, meaning your passwords travel in [plaintext](https://theprivacyguide.org/tutorials/glossary.html#plaintext) over the internet, to be seen by whoever is looking. You don't want your super secure password to be of public knowledge!
Even if they use strong security, websites get hacked (heard of [Ashley Madison hack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashley_Madison_data_breach))? You don't want that one password leak compromises all your accounts, so each site, each account, should have a different password.
